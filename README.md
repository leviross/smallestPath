# smallestPath

Interview coding challenge from a very smart company, I had a lot of fun putting this together. 

Your challenge, if you choose to accept it:
Given a randomly generated pyramid of strings representing integers from 1 to 99 (inclusive), find the path from top to bottom that results in the smallest sum.  As an example:

```
var arr = [
             ["07"],
        ["51", "29"],
     ["13", "11", "70"],
  ["30", "31", "77", "45"]
];
```
That should output an object literal like so:

```
smallestPath(arr)
// {
//   sum: 78,
//   path: ["07", "29", "11", "31"]
// }
```

Please feel free to ask me any questions and send me some critique! To code warriors!
